// Class file for items
// Probably will end up only being two items for now 
// Guide
// First make prototype class
// Then make item that adds in empty tiles
// I guess server knows of items (inventory), then sends image protocols over to client
// Then client needs to cross register with server to see if they own item, if they do, server sends 
// Display protocol and client picks their thing
